# Moroccan Sign Language Recognition Project

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize Moroccan Sign Language (MSL) signs. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and storage of results and misclassification analysis in MongoDB. Additionally, it provides a real-time sign detection script using OpenCV.

## Project Structure

*   **morrocan_sign_language.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data loading, model creation, training, evaluation, and analysis.
*   **moroccan_sign_language_model.h5:** Saved Keras model file (created by the notebook).
*   **README.md:** This file.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python 3:** Programming language
*   **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework
*   **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for image processing
*   **NumPy:** Numerical computing library
*   **Pandas:** Data analysis library
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries
*   **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library
*   **PyMongo:** MongoDB driver for Python
*   **MongoDB Atlas:** Cloud database service (or local MongoDB instance)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.x:** Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
*   **MongoDB Atlas Account (or local MongoDB instance):** You will need a MongoDB Atlas account to store the data, or a local instance of MongoDB running.
*   **Kaggle Account:** To access the dataset directly from Kaggle.

### 2. Install Python Packages

```bash
pip install pymongo dnspython tensorflow scikit-learn opencv-python pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
### 3. MongoDB Configuration

#### MongoDB Atlas Connection String:

 * **1. Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster :** Choose a free tier cluster for testing purposes.
* **2. Create a database user :** Make sure to grant the user read and write access to your chosen database.
* **3. Whitelist your IP address :** You need to allow ur IP address in the Network Access section to allow connections from your current machine.
* **4. Get the connection string:** Go to the "Database" section, click "Connect", and choose "Connect using MongoDB Compass / Shell". Copy the provided connection string. It will look like this:
``` bash
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
``` 
*  **5.Replace the placeholder connection_string :** You need to replace the placeholder connection_string in both the notebook and main() function of realtime_detection.py with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string. Make sure to replace <username>, <password>, and <cluster-address> with your credentials and cluster details.
#### Database and Collection Names:
 The code creates and uses the following MongoDB database and collections within your Atlas cluster:
 - Database: sign_language
 - Collections: metadata, samples, model_data, predictions, misclassified_examples, misclassification_insights, model_results, performance_reports, detection_history (and word_history in real-time detections)

### 4. Dataset Location
The notebook expects the dataset to be located at **/kaggle/input/dataset/ArASL_Database_54K_Final**. If you are running it locally, you need to download the "ArASL_Database_54K_Final" dataset and adjust the dataset_path variable in the notebook accordingly. You need to download it into local directory or change the path.

### 5. Model File
The real-time detection script, realtime_detection.py, expects the trained model to be named moroccan_sign_language_model.h5 and located in the same directory. Ensure that you save the model from the notebook with this name.

## Usage
### 1. Data Loading and Model Training
- Open the **moroccan_sign_language.ipynb** file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

- Run each cell sequentially. This will:

     - Load and preprocess the dataset.
     - Create and train the CNN model.
     - Evaluate the model on the test set.
     - Store model metadata, sample images, training history, confusion matrix, and other performance data in MongoDB.
      - Generate and store misclassification analysis in MongoDB

### 2. Real-time Sign Detection
- Look for Python file named **realtime_detection.py** .
-  Adjust the connection_string in this file to match your MongoDB configuration.
-  Save the moroccan_sign_language_model.h5 file (generated by the notebook) in the same directory as realtime_detection.py.
- Run the script from your terminal:
```bash
python3 realtime_detection.py
```
This will open a window displaying your webcam feed with real-time sign language detection. Press q to exit.
## Data Storage
The project utilizes MongoDB Atlas to store the following:

- Dataset Metadata

- Sample Images

- Model Architecture

- Model Performance Data

- Misclassified Examples

- Misclassification Analysis

- Performance Reports

- Real-time Detections
